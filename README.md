# LPU-Cab-Booking-System
This is a Python Project for booking cabs inside college campus, it uses Python for backend and Tkinter for front end. The data is store in mysql database.

The project was supposed to be a team effort hence only contains areas of development handled by me which includes GUI using Tkinter, Data management using Mysql and 
Data processing and display using python. Comically that also concludes the final project submitted with no contribution from my fellow team members.

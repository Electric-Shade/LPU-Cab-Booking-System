# LPU-Cab-Booking-System
This is a Python Project for booking cabs inside college campus, it uses SQL for backend and Tkinter for front end. 

The project was supposed to be a team effort hence only contains areas of development handled by me which includes GUI using Tkinter, Data management using Mysql and 
Data processing and display using python.
